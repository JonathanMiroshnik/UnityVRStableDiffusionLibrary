using UnityEngine;

// TIMELY NOTES(as of 23.11.24):
// CombineMechanism does not send textures to uiDiffsionTexture and doesn't allow placing textures.
// ^ Also not working for Base Camera Mechanism, the issue is the texture queue in the gadget.


// GENERAL NOTES:
// TODO make a unique ID for everything, downloaded images, uploaded images, request IDs etc
//TODO maybe this is a wrong choice to make ANOTHER diffusion request because this one isn't really a diffusion request at all, just a transfer from one
// TODO notice that these PlaceTextureInput methods are exactly the same for several mechanisms, make it one somewhere?
// TODO do I even NEED the baseCamera workflow? diffusionWorkflows.baseCamera
// TODO make a unique ID for everything, downloaded images, uploaded images, request IDs etc
